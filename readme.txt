simple smtp mail setup for wordpress

== Description ==

Even when are so many plugins doing the same thing, this plugin aims to be simple, lightweight, fast and efficient, this to say to work properly since the beginning.

It is meant to be easy to use to any user, just need to know the SMTP configurations of the email that is being configure.

This plugin it's based on the php smtp email and "forces" Wordpress to use it instead of anything else.

Its ideal to use just this email configurator for optimal usage. If possible have only one in your wp website.

The plugin it self has only two pages, one that explains a little about the plugin and another to configure the email, also its possible to send a test email to check if the email is properly configured
